        <p>Ukraine is preparing for a counter-offensive against Russia, with almost no one knowing when or where it will take place. Russia has built three layers of defensive lines along 120km of the front line in Zaporizhia province in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol. Ukraine's offensive force consists of at least a dozen brigades, nine of which have been armed and supplied by Western allies, but the majority of its vehicles have little or no armour and the amount of artillery is relatively modest.</p>

        <p>EY's decision to pause indefinitely plans for a separation of its audit and advisory businesses is a huge blow to its global bosses, who underestimated just what an uphill climb the break-up project would prove. The big four's growth in recent years has been driven by the rapid expansion of their advisory businesses, which now account for half their combined revenues. The case for staying conjoined is steadily weakening as the big four's businesses shift ever more towards consulting, and the break-up logic is unlikely to go away.</p>

        <p>Tensions between General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and Muhammad Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have escalated into open warfare in Sudan. The conflict began on April 15th with fighting between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, with both sides accusing the other of shooting first. The struggle for power between General Burhan and Mr Dagalo is at the heart of the conflict, with both men refusing to negotiate.</p>

        <p>Japan's carmakers are lagging behind in the global electric vehicle (EV) race, with battery-powered EVs and plug-in hybrids accounting for just 2% of all cars sold in Japan, compared to 20% in China. Established giants like Germany's Volkswagen and newcomers such as Tesla and China's BYD are pulling ahead, while Japanese carmakers are not in the top 20 for global EV sales. Japan's slow start on EVs stems from its earlier successes in hybrid vehicles, and its carmakers are now revving to catch up, with Toyota announcing plans to release ten new EV models and boost annual EV sales to 1.5m by 2026.</p>

        <p>The Indian government has altered the syllabus and textbooks for history and politics in schools to reflect the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) vision of nativism, known as Hindutva.

        <p>Poker is a game that sits between chance and strategy, and the decision-making calculus changes with each new bit of information. There are endless books on poker that promise to turn the reader into a "feared shark" or develop an "unbeatable strategy", but the only thing that will make any player good is playing and losing a lot. However, there are six of the best books on poker that are the most instructive and enjoyable, including The Theory of Poker by David Sklansky, Every Hand Revealed by Gus Hansen, The Education of a Poker Player by Herbert Yardley, The Biggest Game in Town by Al Alvarez, Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker by James McManus, and The Biggest Bluff: How I Learned to Pay Attention, Master Myself and Win by Maria Konnikova.</p>

        <p>"The Wager" by David Grann is a gripping non-fiction account of a British frigate that crashed onto rocks off the coast of Patagonia while pursuing the enemy into the Pacific in 1741. The story revolves around three complex figures, the captain, David Cheap, John Bulkeley, a working seaman, and John Byron, a midshipman, and their power struggle as they become castaways on a small island in the Golfo de Penas. The marooned crew feuded over where to assign fault and how to get home, and the privations that the men endured over the following months and years are almost unimaginable.</p>

        <p>A 21-year-old member of the intelligence wing of the Massachusetts Air National Guard, Jack Teixeira, has been arrested by the FBI for uploading hundreds of classified files over recent months to Discord, a messaging platform. The leaker appears to have shared classified Pentagon slides and CIA assessments with a tight-knit group of friends on Thug Shaker Central, a Discord server, since at least last year. The leaks have shaken America’s national-security bureaucracy, and the fate of the Discord leaker may depend on the damage now wrought by disclosures that he set in motion months ago, and that are only now trickling out—and into the arms of America’s adversaries.</p>

        <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has signed a bill to ban almost all abortions in the state after six weeks of pregnancy, making it even stricter than Georgia's six-week ban. Women will need to provide documentary proof to qualify for the limited exceptions to the ban, and abortions prescribed via telemedicine will become completely illegal. The law would mark a stunning shift for what was until recently considered a swing state, and the impact of the ban will be felt well beyond Florida, which accounts for nearly 10% of abortions in America.</p>

However, the industry highlights some of the uncomfortable trade-offs involved in the global battery business, including environmental concerns and geopolitical issues.</p>

The cap on insurance is $250,000 per account holder, but wealthy individuals and businesses often hold more than that.

        <p>The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has been split into two factions, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) and the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU), due to a political dispute rather than a theological one. The conflict has intensified since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, with the UOC being accused of being a tool of the Kremlin. However, the UOC is a diffuse organisation with many Ukrainian patriots genuinely devoted to their faith, and surveys have shown that individual believers have turned rapidly against the church associated with Moscow since the war started.</p>

        <p>Preparations for peace-making in Ukraine should begin now, despite the lack of political space for talks, according to Jonathan Powell, CEO of Inter Mediate. Powell suggests that groups of friends on both sides, or "peace clubs", could be established to support one side and suggest compromises. He also argues that imaginative ideas beyond the zero-sum game of territory will be needed to achieve a negotiated peace, including a new European security architecture and security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

        <p>Russian hackers are preparing for a new campaign in Ukraine, according to a report by Mandiant, a cybersecurity firm within Google. The report suggests that Russian forces have adapted to circumstances and have shown signs of a more prepared and reinvigorated cyber-programme. The report also warns that Ukraine needs continuous cyber-aid as much as a steady supply of shells.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Russia has been deporting Ukrainian children to camps in Russia and Crimea, where they are subjected to psychological and physical abuse and taught a Russo-centric worldview. The children are used to contribute to the Kremlin's propaganda campaign, which portrays the Russian invasion as a liberation of Ukrainians from a Western-backed fascist regime. The goal is to inspire loyalty to Russia in the parts of Ukraine that Putin claims as his own.</p>

        <p>SpaceX's Starship rocket, designed to be the biggest and cheapest rocket ever built, could transform space travel. The rocket's upper stage is designed to be refuelled in orbit, enabling it to deposit 100 tonnes or more of cargo on the surface of almost any body in the solar system. Starship's capabilities could be used for space tourism, exploration of the outer planets, replenishing shot-down satellites and delivering equipment rapidly to anywhere on the planet.</p>

        <p>SpaceX has unveiled its newest machine, Starship Mk1, which is a prototype of an interplanetary spacecraft. The Starship is designed with planetary colonisation in mind and is capable of lifting around 150 tonnes into orbit, making it the most powerful rocket ever built. Unlike previous rockets, the Starship and its booster will be reusable, which should keep costs down.</p>

        <p>Elon Musk's company, SpaceX, is set to launch Starship SN8, a rocket prototype with a nose cone and three Raptor engines, which is expected to fly to an altitude of 15km, tip forward, and then realign itself vertically before landing. The Starship is intended to be fully recyclable and made of stainless steel, which is cheaper and more resistant to fracturing and damage than carbon-fibre composite. The craft's capacity is 100 tonnes, and it is intended to ferry goods and people into orbits close to Earth, with the Moon as an intended destination.</p>

        <p>The Economist proposes a "banana index" to compare the relative carbon impact of different foods. The index compares popular foodstuffs on three metrics - weight, calories, and protein - indexed to the humble banana, a fruit of middling climate impact and nutritional value. The index shows that beef is bad for the environment no matter how you slice it, while plant-based alternatives to meat do even better.</p>

        <p>The Human Genome Project has revolutionised biology by sequencing the entire human genome, revealing its complexity and turning genetics into a branch of molecular biology. The project has led to the creation of multi-centre collaborations, benefited poorer parts of the world, and changed humanity's understanding of both the world and itself. The continued improvement and cheapening of the process of sequencing has made it possible to understand and treat diseases, and has revealed a diversity of micro-organisms.</p>

        <p>In Bangladesh, a non-profit organisation called Friendship has developed a new design for riverine villages that are often destroyed by floods. The design involves building settlements on raised plinths of densely compacted alluvial earth in a teardrop shape, which allows water to pass by quickly with minimal damage to the island. The plinth villages have been successful in providing security to impoverished families who have been forced to move multiple times due to floods.</p>

        <p>Despite widespread anxiety about the state of the US economy, America remains the world's richest, most productive, and most innovative big economy. By many measures, it is leaving its peers ever further behind. The country's success story is due to a large consumer market, a deep capital market, a high share of immigrants, and a flexible labor market. However, the middle class has seen its post-tax incomes rise by less than those of both the poorest and the richest, and life expectancy in America lags shamefully behind others in the rich world.</p>

        <p>The US economy remains dominant in terms of GDP and productivity, with a highly educated workforce and investment in research and development contributing to its innovative prowess. However, the economy permits extreme volatility in individual livelihoods, with unemployment soaring during downturns and suffering concentrated among the country's poorest, most marginalised communities. Concerns remain over America's harshness of life and unequal income distribution, and the potential for political self-sabotage looms large.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is preparing for a counter-offensive against Russia, with almost no one knowing when or where it will take place. Russia has built three layers of defensive lines along 120km of the front line in Zaporizhia province in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault towards Melitopol. Ukraine's offensive force consists of at least a dozen brigades, nine of which have been armed and supplied by Western allies, but the majority of its vehicles have little or no armour and the amount of artillery is relatively modest.</p>

        <p>The British tax system is flawed due to a profusion of exemptions that distort the economy, confuse taxpayers and deprive the exchequer of revenue. The three main taxes: income tax, national-insurance contributions (NICs) and value-added tax (VAT) are infested with complications and incentivise chicanery. The solution is to fold the two taxes together into one streamlined income tax and scrap the exemptions and use the extra funds to raise the level of benefits.</p>

        <p>French President Emmanuel Macron's recent comments on Europe's stance towards Taiwan were diplomatically dangerous and conceptually wrong, according to The Economist. Macron's suggestion that Europe should not be "followers" of America on a crisis like Taiwan undermines allied support for Taiwan and furthered China's ambition to divide Europeans and peel Europe from America. The article argues that at a time when liberal democratic powers need a coordinated show of strength, Macron's comments have damaged his credibility and the West's unity.</p>
