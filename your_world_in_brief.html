        <p>The number of people forced to flee their homes due to conflict has doubled in the past decade, with roughly 100 million people affected. The majority of these conflicts occur in poor countries, particularly those in hot regions like Sudan. The causes of these conflicts are complex and include eroding global norms, climate change, religious extremism, and organised crime. The world is entering an "age of impunity" as veto-wielding members of the UN Security Council, including Russia and China, object to interference in internal affairs of blood-spattered regimes.</p>

        <p>The global economy is becoming increasingly confusing, with analysts struggling to make accurate predictions. The pandemic has caused disruptions that have made it difficult to interpret economic data, with official statisticians struggling to understand the picture. Structural changes, such as growing non-response rates to official surveys, have also contributed to the confusion, leading to bias and increased data volatility.</p>

        <p>The Dominion lawsuit against Fox News for defamation has shed light on the network's relationship with its audience and competitors. The lawsuit accuses Fox of knowingly spreading lies about Dominion Voting Systems' involvement in the 2020 election. The case is rare as defamation cases often settle out of court, but if it proceeds, it could be a fascinating viewing as it could threaten Fox's First Amendment privileges.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The article discusses how Ukraine is providing a masterclass on cyber-defense to the free world. It highlights the need for democracies to integrate cyber-warfare into regular warfare, protect digital infrastructure, be prepared for cyber-warfare even after conventional war ends, and ensure accountability in cyberspace. The author emphasizes the importance of building partnerships between governments, businesses, and civil society to prevent technology from becoming a tool of oppression and destabilization.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is using fake tanks and guns to deceive the Russians in the ongoing conflict. The use of decoys is not new, but the technology has evolved to make them more convincing. Inflatable dummies are becoming more life-like and can even produce valid radar signals, potentially countering the Russian Lancet drones that are currently decimating Ukrainian artillery.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The UK's new voter-ID requirements will face their first big test in the upcoming local elections on May 4th. The new rules, which were pushed by the government last year, require eligible voters to show a form of photo ID at the ballot box. Proponents argue that the rules are necessary to allay fears of election security, while opponents argue that they will suppress turnout among certain segments of the electorate.</p>

        </div>
        <p>In "Upon Prime," Sarah Hart explores the connection between mathematics and literature, arguing that paying attention to numbers can open up meaning in novels and poems. She examines the role of mathematics in works such as "Jurassic Park," "Life of Pi," and "Moby Dick," and shows how seemingly random dates and figures can contain hidden clues that hint at the theme of the story. Hart's book is written in a light and accessible style, offering readers both insight and entertainment.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Despite concerns from both the left and right about America's economic decline, the country's dominance in the global economy remains striking. While China's economy has surpassed America's in terms of purchasing power, America's pre-eminence is clear when looking at exchange rates set by markets. America's outperformance has translated into wealth for its people, with income per person in America being higher than in Western Europe and Japan. However, America's extreme volatility and lack of investment in social spending have led to problems such as high unemployment and a declining life expectancy, and potential self-sabotage policies threaten to undermine its success.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The article discusses six books that examine the impact of natural disasters on society, politics, and human toll. The books cover a range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and volcanic eruptions, and explore the human decisions that contribute to their impact. The article argues that disasters offer a chance to fix practices that lead to harm and promote resilience, but also highlights the socially produced nature of disasters and the need for measures to mitigate risk.</p>

                <h2>Money Stuff: The SEC Comes for Bittrex</h2>
                <span class="date">09 December 2020</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged Bittrex and its former CEO with operating an unregistered national securities exchange, broker and clearing agency. The SEC alleges that Bittrex facilitated the buying and selling of crypto assets that it considered securities, earning at least $1.3bn in revenues from transaction fees. US regulators are considering whether to require cryptocurrency exchanges to register with the SEC, reflecting the SEC's record of regulatory failure. The SEC is also considering whether to tweak existing rules to allow firms to offer innovative ways of financing using new technologies. The report also discusses interest-rate bets made by Wall Street professionals, the business models of retail stock brokerages, and a lawsuit against Fox Corp. over its coverage of the US election.</p>
