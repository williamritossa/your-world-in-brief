        <p>Joe Biden has announced his re-election bid for the 2024 presidential race, marking his fourth attempt at the presidency. Despite his age and familiarity, 70% of Americans want him to run, including 50% of Democrats. However, his approval rating is not as high as past American presidents or current prime ministers in Western countries. While he has achieved some successes in his presidency, such as preventing Russia from taking Ukraine and pursuing an industrial policy aimed at increasing domestic manufacture of semiconductor chips, his campaign and the uncertain factors beyond his control make the 2024 election much uncertain.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> As an expert advisor, it is important to note that while Biden's age and familiarity may be a concern for some, his experience and achievements in his presidency cannot be overlooked. However, his campaign and the uncertain factors beyond his control, such as the economy and the potential for Trump to be the nominee, make the 2024 election much uncertain. It is also worth noting that the Democratic Party has plenty of talent, but they need to unite behind a nominee to have a chance at winning the election.</p>

        <p>Israel celebrated its 75th anniversary on April 25th, marking the founding of the country in 1948. However, the occasion was marred by political tensions and protests against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government. Israel is facing several challenges, including changing demographics, a polarized society, and a low productivity economy. The country's future looks ominous as demographic changes could hurt the army and the economy, and the rising right may drive parts of the educated, centrist middle class.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Israel's 75th anniversary is a significant milestone, but it is also a time of political tensions and protests. The changing demographics and polarized society pose significant challenges for the country's future. The low productivity economy is also a concern, and it is essential to address the issues of public and private investment, education, and traffic. The rising right and the belief in 'greater Israel' could lead to further tensions and conflicts with the Palestinians. It is crucial to find a way to address these issues and ensure a stable and prosperous future for Israel.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The article discusses President Joe Biden's ambitious plan to reshape the American economy through government action. The plan involves investing $2 trillion in infrastructure, semiconductor chips, and green technology to reindustrialize America, bolster national security, revive left-behind places, and reduce carbon emissions. However, the plan is risky and may face challenges such as conflicting goals, protectionism, and lack of affordable workers. The article suggests that sustained trade diplomacy, subsidies for commercially viable technologies, and permit law reforms are needed to help the plan succeed.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> President, it is important to note that while the plan is ambitious, it may face challenges such as conflicting goals and protectionism. It is crucial to balance the need for domestic industry with sustained trade diplomacy and subsidies for commercially viable technologies. Additionally, permit law reforms may be necessary to build new subsidised infrastructure. Historical examples of dirigiste industrial policies, such as American environmentalism, suggest that government management of ambitious projects may lead to inefficiencies and lobbying rather than innovation and competition. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of the plan and make necessary adjustments to ensure its success.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Tucker Carlson, a popular host on Fox News, has recently parted ways with the network amidst a lawsuit filed by a former producer accusing the network and Carlson's staff of sexism and anti-Semitism. Carlson, who is known for his hard-edged political views and support of former President Trump, has also faced criticism for downplaying the January 6th Capitol riot and airing selectively edited videos. This departure, along with the departure of other Trump-boosting hosts, serves as a reminder that even popular hosts are not bigger than the network and may be shown the door if their antics become costly and embarrassing.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The departure of Tucker Carlson from Fox News is a significant event in the world of cable news and politics. It highlights the ongoing tension between conservative media outlets and accusations of sexism, anti-Semitism, and defamation. This tension is not new and has been present in American politics for decades, with conservative media outlets often being accused of pandering to their base and promoting partisan political programs over factual reporting. The departure of Carlson and other Trump-boosting hosts may signal a shift in the way conservative media outlets operate and the need for greater accountability and responsibility in reporting.</p>

                <h2>Big pharma’s patent cliff is fast approaching</h2>
                <span class="date">20 April 2023</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Big pharma companies are facing a patent cliff as patents for 190 drugs expire at the end of the decade, leaving sales worth $236bn at risk of a dramatic drop-off. Merck, one of the world's biggest drugmakers, has acquired Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8bn, a biotech firm based in California, to replenish its drugs pipeline. The pharmaceutical industry is turning to dealmaking as a way of compensating for the potential loss of revenue from expiring patents, with drugmakers driving a wave of consolidation across the sector.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The patent cliff is not a new phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past, companies have turned to mergers and acquisitions to offset the loss of revenue from expiring patents. However, this strategy is not always successful, as mergers can be costly and may not always result in the development of new drugs. It is important for the government to consider policies that encourage innovation and the development of new drugs, rather than relying solely on mergers and acquisitions to sustain the industry.</p>

                <h2>Why crashing lithium prices will not make electric cars cheaper</h2>
                <span class="date">20 April 2023</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The price of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. After a twelve-fold increase in prices due to the surge in EV sales, prices have now halved due to slowing demand in China and carmakers reviewing their supply deals. However, the global supply of mined lithium is rising fast, and prices are unlikely to fall far enough to bury big miners' profits. In the longer run, rising demand for lithium energy storage, supported by green policies in America, Europe, and China, could make the market even tighter.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The recent fluctuations in lithium prices highlight the importance of diversifying the sources of critical minerals for EV batteries. The US and other countries should invest in domestic mining and recycling of lithium and other minerals to reduce their dependence on foreign sources. The US government should also consider policies to promote the development and adoption of advanced battery technologies that use less or no lithium, such as solid-state batteries, to reduce the environmental and geopolitical risks associated with lithium mining and supply chain.</p>

        <p>Despite repeated tightening Western sanctions, Russia’s economy has recovered poise and is expected to grow 0.7% this year, on par with France, while even the British and German economies shrink. Russia has found ways to withstand the fusillade of sanctions and supplied enough men and materiel to propel its invasion without a sharp decline in living standards that might prompt popular unrest. However, the question is not whether Russia can endure an even longer war of attrition, but whether it can support the sort of intensification of conflict that it probably needs to transform the prospects on the battlefield.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the resilience of the Russian economy in the face of Western sanctions and the challenges that Russia faces in intensifying the conflict in Ukraine. It is important to note that Russia has a history of enduring long wars, such as during World War II when it spent an astonishing 60% of its GDP on the military. However, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of a more intense conflict, including the impact on the global economy and the potential for further destabilization in the region.</p>

        <p>Ukraine's air force has lost 60 fighter jets since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, and the country's air balance is looking shaky. Ukraine needs a fresh fleet of fighter jets, and the Gripen, built by Saab, is one candidate. However, the main problem with the Gripen is that Sweden has sold or leased around 66 countries, and there are fewer than 100 available. Ukraine is also eying the second-hand market, but the cost of resurfacing airfields would invite Russian missiles. Many Western officials insist that the debate over fighter jets is a distraction from resupplying Ukrainian surface-to-air missiles.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The situation in Ukraine is reminiscent of the Cold War era, where the US and the Soviet Union engaged in an arms race. The US provided military aid to countries such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua, while the Soviet Union provided military aid to countries such as Cuba and Vietnam. The current situation in Ukraine is similar, with the US and its allies providing military aid to Ukraine, while Russia provides military aid to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The debate over fighter jets is just one aspect of this larger conflict.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is using fake tanks and guns to deceive the Russians in the ongoing war. The use of decoys is not new, as spoofs were used in the first world war to distract and confuse the enemy. Ukraine has taken this to a new level by using inflatable prototypes that are cheaper to manufacture and easier to transport. The dummies are becoming more life-like and can produce valid radar signals, fool thermal imaging cameras, and even counter the Russian Lancet drones that are currently decimating Ukrainian artillery.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The use of decoys in warfare is not new and has been used throughout history. The use of inflatable prototypes is a cost-effective and innovative way to deceive the enemy. This tactic has been used in the past, such as during the D-Day invasion, and has proven to be effective. The use of decoys can also be seen as a way to economically deplete the enemy's resources and force them to waste ammunition and time on fake targets. However, it is important to note that the use of decoys should not be relied upon solely and should be used in conjunction with other tactics and strategies.</p>

        <p>The article discusses how Russia's invasion of Ukraine has disrupted the criminal underworld and smuggling networks in the region. The vast majority of Ukrainian mobsters stopped collaborating with their Russian peers, and lucrative heroin-smuggling routes were remapped, affecting prices and profits of criminal syndicates thousands of miles away. The war has also created new short-term opportunities for gangsters in Ukraine, such as people-smuggling and smuggling conscripts.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The disruption of criminal networks in Ukraine due to the war with Russia presents an opportunity for the country to make permanent diminution of organized crime. However, the reconstruction process could easily be preyed upon by mafias, and the country must take internal efforts to combat corruption and reform urban planning. The war has also intensified links between organized criminals and the Russian state, which could have long-term malign impacts on global crime.</p>

        <p>Ukraine's air force has lost 60 fighter jets since Russia invaded Ukraine last year, and the country's air balance is looking shaky. Ukraine needs a fresh fleet of fighter jets, and the Gripen, built by Saab, is one candidate. However, the main problem with the Gripen is that Sweden has sold or leased around 66 countries, and there are fewer than 100 available. Ukraine is also eying the second-hand market, but the cost of resurfacing airfields would invite Russian missiles. Many Western officials insist that the debate over fighter jets is a distraction from resupplying Ukrainian surface-to-air missiles.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The situation in Ukraine is reminiscent of the Cold War era, where the US and the Soviet Union engaged in an arms race. The US provided military aid to countries such as Afghanistan and Nicaragua, while the Soviet Union provided military aid to countries such as Cuba and Vietnam. The current situation in Ukraine is similar, with the US and its allies providing military aid to Ukraine, while Russia provides military aid to separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The debate over fighter jets is just one aspect of this larger conflict.</p>

                <h2>Arab tourism to Israel is still thwarted by politics and Palestine</h2>

        <p>Arab tourism to Israel is still hindered by political tensions with Palestine. Despite the popularity of Israeli-run festivals and beach resorts in the Sinai peninsula, many Egyptians and other Arabs are opposed to Israeli tourism. The Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries, have not led to an influx of Arab tourists to Israel due to continuing anger towards the Palestinian situation.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the ongoing political tensions between Israel and Palestine, which continue to impact tourism in the region. It is important to note that the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab countries through the Abraham Accords has not yet led to a significant increase in Arab tourism to Israel. This may be due to the fact that many Arabs still hold negative views towards Israel due to the ongoing Palestinian conflict, as well as historical events such as the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is preparing for a long-planned counter-offensive against Russian invaders who have illegally occupied almost a fifth of the country. Ukraine has received a bonanza of NATO-standard weapons, including tanks, precision missile systems, powerful artillery, and millions of rounds of ammunition. The battlefield has been static for the past five months, but Ukraine may never have a better chance to break or at least disrupt the land bridge that connects Crimea to Russia via Donbas.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the importance of Ukraine's upcoming counter-offensive against Russian invaders and the potential impact it could have on the fate of Ukraine and its alliances with the West. It is crucial for the US and other European powers to provide military support to Ukraine and make clear their commitment to its territorial integrity. The historical context of the 1994 agreement underwriting Ukraine's territorial integrity should also be considered when discussing future security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

                <h2>Why civil wars are lasting longer</h2>

        <p>The average duration of ongoing conflicts has increased from 13 years in the mid-1980s to 20 years in 2021. The number of battle deaths has also risen since the Arab Spring in 2011, and the total death toll is hard to measure as victims die from war and become less able to resist disease. Wars are lasting longer due to growing complexity, criminality, and climate change. Peacemaking is hard but necessary, and it often involves starting unofficial talks, including women and civil-society groups in the peace process, and experimenting with different peacemaking templates.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The increasing duration of civil wars is a global calamity that requires urgent attention. Historical events, such as the Arab Spring, have contributed to the rise in battle deaths and the total death toll. Policies that promote peace and build better institutions in fragile states are necessary to curb the effects of climate change and prevent conflicts. The president should consider investing in these policies to prevent further bloodshed and promote global peace.</p>

                <h2>The myth of English identity</h2>

        <p>The article discusses the myth of English identity and the rise of English nationalism in recent British politics. While some argue that Englishness is the motor force behind recent political ructions, others argue that the rise of English identity is largely a myth. Despite devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, Britain's departure from the EU, and the rise and fall of UKIP, the proportion of British people who identify predominantly as English has barely budged. The article concludes that Englishness is a poorly defined concept and that nationalism flourishes where people feel thwarted.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The rise of English nationalism in recent British politics can be seen as a response to feelings of being left behind and thwarted. This is not a new phenomenon in British history, as similar sentiments have been seen in the past, such as during the Scottish independence referendum. It is important to understand the historical and cultural context of English identity and nationalism in order to effectively address the concerns of those who identify as predominantly English.</p>

        <p>Credit Suisse posted a net profit of CHF 12.43 billion in the first quarter of 2021, despite losing $2 billion in the same period. UBS is expected to report a gain of CHF 51 billion in the second quarter of 2021 due to the acquisition of Credit Suisse. Trillium Capital LLC has announced a non-binding proposal to acquire Getty Images Holding for $10 per share in cash. Trillium may also consider permitting holders of large block shares, such as the Getty Family, Koch Industries and Neuberger Berman, to roll their shares into the transaction. Meanwhile, First Republic Bank's quarterly results have reignited investor concerns about the bank's prospects, with customer deposits plunging 41% to $104.5bn in the first quarter.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Credit Suisse's net profit in the first quarter of 2021 is impressive, but it is important to note that the bank lost $2 billion in the same period. The acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to result in a gain of CHF 51 billion for UBS in the second quarter of 2021. Trillium Capital's proposal to acquire Getty Images Holding for $10 per share in cash is subject to due diligence and financing arrangements. The decline in customer deposits at First Republic Bank is a cause for concern and may indicate underlying issues with the bank's prospects.</p>
