        </div>
        <p>Joe Biden has announced his re-election bid for the 2024 presidential race, marking his fourth attempt at the presidency. Despite his age and familiarity, 70% of Americans want him to run, including 50% of Democrats. However, his approval rating is not as high as past American presidents or current prime ministers in Western countries. While he has achieved some successes in his presidency, such as preventing Russia from taking Ukraine and pursuing an industrial policy aimed at increasing domestic manufacture of semiconductor chips, his campaign and the uncertain factors beyond his control make the 2024 election much uncertain.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> As an expert advisor, it is important to note that while Biden's age and familiarity may be a concern for some, his experience and achievements in his presidency cannot be overlooked. However, his campaign and the uncertain factors beyond his control, such as the economy and the potential for Trump to be the nominee, make the 2024 election much uncertain. It is also worth noting that the Democratic Party has plenty of talent, but they need to unite behind a nominee to have a chance at winning the election.</p>

        <p>The private-equity industry is entering a new era, one that is more subdued and less focused on growth assets.

        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The private-equity industry has gone through cycles of growth and decline, and this new era is reminiscent of the industry's pre-history. The industry may need to focus on operational improvements to raise profitability, which could lead to political opposition in sensitive industries such as healthcare. Private-equity managers with deep industry expertise and skilled operating professionals may prosper in this new era.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Israel celebrated its 75th anniversary on April 25th, marking the founding of the country in 1948. However, the occasion was marred by political tensions and protests against Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's government. Israel is facing several challenges, including changing demographics, a polarized society, and a low productivity economy. The country's future looks ominous as demographic changes could hurt the army and the economy, and the rising right may drive parts of the educated, centrist middle class.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Israel's 75th anniversary is a significant milestone, but it is also a time of political tensions and protests. The changing demographics and polarized society pose significant challenges for the country's future. The low productivity economy is also a concern, and it is essential to address the issues of public and private investment, education, and traffic. The rising right and the belief in 'greater Israel' could lead to further tensions and conflicts with the Palestinians. It is crucial to find a way to address these issues and ensure a stable and prosperous future for Israel.</p>

                <h2>Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s autocrat, is winning</h2>
                <span class="date">25 April 2023</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Despite a collapsed economy, rigged elections, and stiff sanctions imposed by the US, Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela's autocratic president, seems to be growing stronger politically. He has systematically undermined the country's institutions and keeps the army loyal by allowing officers to run lucrative rackets. Two international developments have played to Maduro's advantage: the global scramble for alternatives to Russian oil and the recent election of several left-wing leaders in Latin America. However, the economy is still in a precarious state, and there is an acute shortage of hard currency. The International Criminal Court has released details of consultations with alleged victims of human-rights abuses in Venezuela, which may result in prosecutions.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The situation in Venezuela is complex and has been developing for many years. The country's economy has been in decline for over a decade, and the political situation is highly polarized. The US has been involved in the situation for some time, imposing sanctions and supporting the opposition. However, the recent shift in US policy towards Venezuela may be playing into Maduro's hands. The easing of sanctions and the reassessment of the relationship with the regime may be seen as a sign of weakness, and could embolden Maduro. The situation in Venezuela is also closely linked to wider geopolitical trends, such as the global scramble for energy resources and the rise of left-wing governments in Latin America. It is important to understand these wider trends in order to fully appreciate the situation in Venezuela.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The revelation of American wiretapping has added fuel to the fiery partisan politics in South Korea. The government says trust in the United States remains intact, but the opposition rightly notes that spying constitutes a serious breach of trust. The South Korea-US security alliance turns 70 years old this year, and South Korea needs to be more assertive to remain a strong partner.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> As a former foreign minister of South Korea, I recommend that the United States should acknowledge the breach of trust caused by the wiretapping scandal and take steps to rebuild trust with South Korea. Additionally, the United States should be aware of the deep undercurrent of public sentiment in South Korea towards Japan and the need for Japan to fully and honestly come to terms with its past atrocities to give a real, lasting boost to trust between the two neighbors and the region as a whole.</p>

        <p>Data published by the Centre of Extremism (COE) showed that 25 extremist-related murders in the US in 2022 had connections to the far right. The data also revealed that far-right extremists were responsible for the majority of killings in the US, with no single organised group, but rather a variety of ideologies, anti-government beliefs and white supremacy. The data shows that extremist attacks are on an upward trend, and that attacks are being carried out by lone wolves, making it especially hard for law enforcement to trace and monitor.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The rise of far-right extremism in the US is a concerning trend that has been on the rise since the early 2000s. The fact that these attacks are being carried out by lone wolves makes it difficult for law enforcement to prevent them. It is important to note that far-right ideas have also influenced mainstream politics, which can further inflame public opinion and encourage violence.</p>

This is in contrast to the books written by Conservative cabinet ministers, which tend to focus on the party's past achievements. The fact that the Labour books are not particularly entertaining or engaging may reflect the party's focus on serious issues and the challenges facing the country. Overall, the article suggests that reading these books can provide valuable insights into the Labour party's views and priorities.</p>

        <p>The article discusses the popularity of President Joe Biden based on the results of a weekly survey conducted by YouGov since 2009. The survey covers a range of issues, including presidential job approval, relevant news events, important government policy proposals, and the state of the economy. The article presents data visualizations that explore the trends in presidential approval ratings and the popularity of Joe Biden's policies among different demographic groups. While Biden's economic infrastructure stimulus packages are particularly popular, his positions on issues such as gun control and border control are much less popular.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> President Biden's popularity is an important factor in his ability to pass his policy agenda. While his economic stimulus packages have been popular, his positions on other issues such as gun control and border control are less so. It is worth noting that Republican lawmakers have pledged to oppose Biden's agenda, regardless of its popularity among voters. This could pose a potential barrier to future policy initiatives. It is also worth considering historical trends in presidential approval ratings and the factors that have contributed to their rise and fall.</p>

        <p>The article discusses President Joe Biden's ambitious plan to reshape the American economy through government action. The plan involves investing $2 trillion in infrastructure, semiconductor chips, and green technology to reindustrialize America, bolster national security, revive left-behind places, and reduce carbon emissions. However, the plan is risky and may face challenges such as conflicting goals, protectionism, and lack of affordable workers. The article suggests that sustained trade diplomacy, subsidies for commercially viable technologies, and permit law reforms are needed to help the plan succeed.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> President, it is important to note that while the plan is ambitious, it may face challenges such as conflicting goals and protectionism. It is crucial to balance the need for domestic industry with sustained trade diplomacy and subsidies for commercially viable technologies. Additionally, permit law reforms may be necessary to build new subsidised infrastructure. Historical examples of dirigiste industrial policies, such as American environmentalism, suggest that government management of ambitious projects may lead to inefficiencies and lobbying rather than innovation and competition. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of the plan and make necessary adjustments to ensure its success.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Tucker Carlson, a popular host on Fox News, has recently parted ways with the network amidst a lawsuit filed by a former producer accusing the network and Carlson's staff of sexism and anti-Semitism. Carlson, who is known for his hard-edged political views and support of former President Trump, has also faced criticism for downplaying the January 6th Capitol riot and airing selectively edited videos. This departure, along with the departure of other Trump-boosting hosts, serves as a reminder that even popular hosts are not bigger than the network and may be shown the door if their antics become costly and embarrassing.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The departure of Tucker Carlson from Fox News is a significant event in the world of cable news and politics. It highlights the ongoing tension between conservative media outlets and accusations of sexism, anti-Semitism, and defamation. This tension is not new and has been present in American politics for decades, with conservative media outlets often being accused of pandering to their base and promoting partisan political programs over factual reporting. The departure of Carlson and other Trump-boosting hosts may signal a shift in the way conservative media outlets operate and the need for greater accountability and responsibility in reporting.</p>

        <p>Fox News settled a mammoth defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5m, half of what Dominion first sought in damages. The lawsuit laid bare the extent to which Fox News' coverage shaped its audience's desire to hear what they want to hear, as well as its fractious relationship with Donald Trump. The settlement reflects a commitment to the highest journalistic standards, according to Fox News.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The Dominion lawsuit against Fox News highlights the power of media in shaping public opinion and the potential consequences of spreading false information. This is not the first time Rupert Murdoch's media empire has landed in legal trouble, as seen in the phone-hacking scandal of News World. The settlement also sheds light on the fractious relationship between Fox News and Donald Trump, and the extent to which the network followed its audience rather than leading them. This raises questions about the role of media in democracy and the responsibility of news outlets to report accurate information.</p>

        <p>Rupert Murdoch, the 90-year-old billionaire media tycoon, is preparing to hand over his media empire. After the phone-hacking scandal, Murdoch split News Corporation into two, putting lucrative TV film assets 21st Century Fox and scandal-hit newspapers quarantined News Corp. The next chapter is trickier as Fox, the larger company, is facing a decade-long decline in American cable TV and Fox News, which made 80% of the company's money last year, is facing problems due to its close relationship with Donald Trump's White House.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Rupert Murdoch's media empire has been a powerful force in shaping public opinion and politics for decades. The decline of cable TV and the rise of streaming services pose a significant challenge to the future of Fox, the larger company in the empire. The close relationship between Fox News and Donald Trump's White House has generated record ratings but also alienated advertisers and investors. The succession question and the family politics surrounding it may also impact the future of the empire.</p>

        <p>The article discusses the future of Fox News after the Trump presidency. Fox News has been a reliable ally of the Trump administration, with hosts amplifying pro-Trump conspiracy theories and giving the president unchallenged airtime. However, after the election, Fox News anchors have become more gutsy and have reported on the election results more accurately. The article suggests that Fox News may face competition from rival conservative channels, but Fox News still looks buoyant as advertising makes up 30% of its revenue.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Fox News has been a significant player in American politics, with its conservative views and support for the Republican Party. However, the relationship between Fox News and the Trump administration has been unique, with Fox News amplifying pro-Trump conspiracy theories and giving the president unchallenged airtime. The recent election has shown that Fox News may be losing its grip on the conservative audience, with rival conservative channels such as Newsmax and One America News gaining popularity. It remains to be seen how Fox News will adapt to this changing landscape and whether it will continue to be a dominant force in American politics.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Former President Donald Trump is facing a civil trial in New York for alleged rape of a woman 25 years ago. The accuser, E. Jean Carroll, is a former columnist who claims the rape took place in a New York department store in the mid-1990s. Although the case is not a criminal one, a guilty verdict would harm Trump's chances of returning to the White House.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The case against former President Trump is significant as it is the first prominent lawsuit heard under the Adult Survivors Act (ASA) and is being watched closely by victims of sexual assault who have yet to decide whether to come forward with historical allegations. The ASA grants adult victims of sexual assault a year to file historical claims in civil court. The lack of hard evidence in the case means that lawyers will rely on establishing or attacking the accuser's credibility. The outcome of the case could have political implications for Trump, as well as legal ones.</p>

                <h2>Fearing China, Australia rethinks its defence strategy</h2>
                <span class="date">25 April 2023</span>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Australia is rethinking its defence strategy due to the rising risks of military escalation and major conflict in the Indo-Pacific region, with concerns over China's military build-up and its assertion of sovereignty in the South China Sea. The country's defence minister has endorsed the conclusions of a new review, which sees Australia's defences as no longer fit for purpose, and argues that the country must be able to project power farther shores to defend well and preserve peace in the region.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Australia's strategic shift in defence posture towards China is not new, but the recent review highlights the urgency of the situation. The country's reliance on global trade and its vulnerability to blockades make it imperative to develop longer-range strike capabilities and upgrade northern ports and bases. The AUKUS trilateral pact with the US and UK to supply Australia with nuclear-propelled submarines is a significant step towards this goal, but the government must also address its ropy procurement record and looming skills shortages in the defence establishment.</p>

        <p>South Korea's President Yoon Suk-yeol has promised to make South Korea a champion of human rights and a global pivotal state, pushing liberal values in developing and developed countries alike. However, his reluctance to show global leadership promised is striking, as South Korea has refused requests from America and NATO to supply Ukraine with lethal weapons and is far loth to distance itself from China. South Korea's mutual concern with America over North Korea represents a powerful adhesive, but the country is inching towards following America's lead on matters, including China, cautiously.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> South Korea's reluctance to show global leadership is understandable given its reliance on China as its largest trade partner and the fact that supply chains for its important industries, such as semiconductors, are largely China-based. However, South Korea's mutual concern with America over North Korea represents a powerful adhesive, and the country is increasingly minded to follow America's lead on matters, including China, albeit cautiously. The 70th anniversary of the alliance between South Korea and America marks a significant milestone, and it is important for both countries to continue to work together to address the challenges posed by China and North Korea.</p>

        <p>The article discusses the changing landscape of China's startup scene, with a focus on the sectors and regions that are currently prioritized. The government is heavily involved in bankrolling innovation and promoting self-reliance in key industries such as green energy, semiconductors, and biotech. State-owned firms are increasingly taking on a role as startup incubators, and there has been a shift away from privately controlled tech giants towards new sources of funding, often backed by the state.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> China's push for self-reliance in key industries is not a new phenomenon. Similar policies were implemented during the Mao era, with mixed results. It remains to be seen whether the current emphasis on state-backed startups will lead to long-term success or simply create new bubbles that eventually burst. The government's heavy involvement in the tech industry also raises concerns about censorship and surveillance, which could have implications for foreign investors and companies operating in China.</p>

        <p>The resignation of Dominic Raab, Britain's former deputy prime minister and justice secretary, following an investigation into allegations of workplace bullying has sparked a debate on what constitutes bullying in the workplace. While some of Raab's supporters argue that his departure sets an unhealthily low bar for what constitutes bullying, others contend that the number and consistency of complaints against him suggest that something was genuinely amiss. The article argues that bullying is often incremental and that even if Raab was unfairly labelled a bully, his effectiveness as a manager was called into question.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The case of Dominic Raab highlights the importance of addressing workplace bullying and the need for clear definitions and guidelines on what constitutes bullying. It also underscores the potential consequences of a toxic workplace culture, including the loss of talented employees and damage to an organization's reputation. This is not the first time that allegations of workplace bullying have been made against a high-ranking government official, and it is important to learn from past mistakes and take steps to prevent such behavior in the future.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>Big pharma companies are facing a patent cliff as patents for 190 drugs expire at the end of the decade, leaving sales worth $236bn at risk of a dramatic drop-off. Merck, one of the world's biggest drugmakers, has acquired Prometheus Biosciences for $10.8bn, a biotech firm based in California, to replenish its drugs pipeline. The pharmaceutical industry is turning to dealmaking as a way of compensating for the potential loss of revenue from expiring patents, with drugmakers driving a wave of consolidation across the sector.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The patent cliff is not a new phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. In the past, companies have turned to mergers and acquisitions to offset the loss of revenue from expiring patents. However, this strategy is not always successful, as mergers can be costly and may not always result in the development of new drugs. It is important for the government to consider policies that encourage innovation and the development of new drugs, rather than relying solely on mergers and acquisitions to sustain the industry.</p>

                <h2>Why crashing lithium prices will not make electric cars cheaper</h2>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The price of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries, has been on a rollercoaster ride in recent years. After a twelve-fold increase in prices due to the surge in EV sales, prices have now halved due to slowing demand in China and carmakers reviewing their supply deals. However, the global supply of mined lithium is rising fast, and prices are unlikely to fall far enough to bury big miners' profits. In the longer run, rising demand for lithium energy storage, supported by green policies in America, Europe, and China, could make the market even tighter.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The recent fluctuations in lithium prices highlight the importance of diversifying the sources of critical minerals for EV batteries. The US and other countries should invest in domestic mining and recycling of lithium and other minerals to reduce their dependence on foreign sources. The US government should also consider policies to promote the development and adoption of advanced battery technologies that use less or no lithium, such as solid-state batteries, to reduce the environmental and geopolitical risks associated with lithium mining and supply chain.</p>

        <p>Despite repeated tightening Western sanctions, Russia’s economy has recovered poise and is expected to grow 0.7% this year, on par with France, while even the British and German economies shrink. Russia has found ways to withstand the fusillade of sanctions and supplied enough men and materiel to propel its invasion without a sharp decline in living standards that might prompt popular unrest. However, the question is not whether Russia can endure an even longer war of attrition, but whether it can support the sort of intensification of conflict that it probably needs to transform the prospects on the battlefield.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the resilience of the Russian economy in the face of Western sanctions and the challenges that Russia faces in intensifying the conflict in Ukraine. It is important to note that Russia has a history of enduring long wars, such as during World War II when it spent an astonishing 60% of its GDP on the military. However, it is also important to consider the potential consequences of a more intense conflict, including the impact on the global economy and the potential for further destabilization in the region.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is using fake tanks and guns to deceive the Russians in the ongoing war. The use of decoys is not new, as spoofs were used in the first world war to distract and confuse the enemy. Ukraine has taken this to a new level by using inflatable prototypes that are cheaper to manufacture and easier to transport. The dummies are becoming more life-like and can produce valid radar signals, fool thermal imaging cameras, and even counter the Russian Lancet drones that are currently decimating Ukrainian artillery.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The use of decoys in warfare is not new and has been used throughout history. The use of inflatable prototypes is a cost-effective and innovative way to deceive the enemy. This tactic has been used in the past, such as during the D-Day invasion, and has proven to be effective. The use of decoys can also be seen as a way to economically deplete the enemy's resources and force them to waste ammunition and time on fake targets. However, it is important to note that the use of decoys should not be relied upon solely and should be used in conjunction with other tactics and strategies.</p>

The vast majority of Ukrainian mobsters stopped collaborating with their Russian peers, and lucrative heroin-smuggling routes were remapped, affecting prices and profits of criminal syndicates thousands of miles away.

        <p>Arab tourism to Israel is still hindered by political tensions with Palestine. Despite the popularity of Israeli-run festivals and beach resorts in the Sinai peninsula, many Egyptians and other Arabs are opposed to Israeli tourism. The Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab countries, have not led to an influx of Arab tourists to Israel due to continuing anger towards the Palestinian situation.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the ongoing political tensions between Israel and Palestine, which continue to impact tourism in the region. It is important to note that the normalization of relations between Israel and Arab countries through the Abraham Accords has not yet led to a significant increase in Arab tourism to Israel. This may be due to the fact that many Arabs still hold negative views towards Israel due to the ongoing Palestinian conflict, as well as historical events such as the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is preparing for a long-planned counter-offensive against Russian invaders who have illegally occupied almost a fifth of the country. Ukraine has received a bonanza of NATO-standard weapons, including tanks, precision missile systems, powerful artillery, and millions of rounds of ammunition. The battlefield has been static for the past five months, but Ukraine may never have a better chance to break or at least disrupt the land bridge that connects Crimea to Russia via Donbas.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The article highlights the importance of Ukraine's upcoming counter-offensive against Russian invaders and the potential impact it could have on the fate of Ukraine and its alliances with the West. It is crucial for the US and other European powers to provide military support to Ukraine and make clear their commitment to its territorial integrity. The historical context of the 1994 agreement underwriting Ukraine's territorial integrity should also be considered when discussing future security guarantees for Ukraine.</p>

                <h2>Why civil wars are lasting longer</h2>

        <p>The average duration of ongoing conflicts has increased from 13 years in the mid-1980s to 20 years in 2021. The number of battle deaths has also risen since the Arab Spring in 2011, and the total death toll is hard to measure as victims die from war and become less able to resist disease. Wars are lasting longer due to growing complexity, criminality, and climate change. Peacemaking is hard but necessary, and it often involves starting unofficial talks, including women and civil-society groups in the peace process, and experimenting with different peacemaking templates.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The increasing duration of civil wars is a global calamity that requires urgent attention. Historical events, such as the Arab Spring, have contributed to the rise in battle deaths and the total death toll. Policies that promote peace and build better institutions in fragile states are necessary to curb the effects of climate change and prevent conflicts. The president should consider investing in these policies to prevent further bloodshed and promote global peace.</p>

                <h2>The myth of English identity</h2>

        <p>The article discusses the myth of English identity and the rise of English nationalism in recent British politics. While some argue that Englishness is the motor force behind recent political ructions, others argue that the rise of English identity is largely a myth. Despite devolution of power to Scotland and Wales, Britain's departure from the EU, and the rise and fall of UKIP, the proportion of British people who identify predominantly as English has barely budged. The article concludes that Englishness is a poorly defined concept and that nationalism flourishes where people feel thwarted.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> The rise of English nationalism in recent British politics can be seen as a response to feelings of being left behind and thwarted. This is not a new phenomenon in British history, as similar sentiments have been seen in the past, such as during the Scottish independence referendum. It is important to understand the historical and cultural context of English identity and nationalism in order to effectively address the concerns of those who identify as predominantly English.</p>

        <p>Credit Suisse posted a net profit of CHF 12.43 billion in the first quarter of 2021, despite losing $2 billion in the same period. UBS is expected to report a gain of CHF 51 billion in the second quarter of 2021 due to the acquisition of Credit Suisse. Trillium Capital LLC has announced a non-binding proposal to acquire Getty Images Holding for $10 per share in cash. Trillium may also consider permitting holders of large block shares, such as the Getty Family, Koch Industries and Neuberger Berman, to roll their shares into the transaction. Meanwhile, First Republic Bank's quarterly results have reignited investor concerns about the bank's prospects, with customer deposits plunging 41% to $104.5bn in the first quarter.</p>
        <p><span style="color: #E3120B;">Opinion:</span> Credit Suisse's net profit in the first quarter of 2021 is impressive, but it is important to note that the bank lost $2 billion in the same period. The acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS is expected to result in a gain of CHF 51 billion for UBS in the second quarter of 2021. Trillium Capital's proposal to acquire Getty Images Holding for $10 per share in cash is subject to due diligence and financing arrangements. The decline in customer deposits at First Republic Bank is a cause for concern and may indicate underlying issues with the bank's prospects.</p>
